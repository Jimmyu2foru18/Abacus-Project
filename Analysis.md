# Abacus Project Analysis

## 1. Introduction
The Abacus Project aims to create an interactive, web-based abacus calculator that provides both educational value and practical utility. This digital implementation of the ancient calculating tool will help users understand place values, arithmetic operations, and develop mental math skills while offering a visually appealing interface.

## 2. Overview
### 2.1 Project Concept
The Abacus Project is an interactive web application that simulates a traditional Chinese suanpan abacus with 13 rods. Users can manipulate beads through intuitive drag-and-drop interactions to perform calculations ranging from basic arithmetic to complex operations. The application serves both as an educational tool for understanding numerical concepts and as a practical calculator for daily use.

### 2.2 Target Audience
- Students learning basic mathematics and place value concepts
- Educators teaching arithmetic and historical calculating methods
- Enthusiasts of traditional calculation tools
- Users seeking an alternative visualization for numerical operations
- Anyone interested in improving mental math abilities

## 3. Requirements
### 3.1 Functional Requirements
1. **Bead Manipulation**
   - Click-and-drag bead movement
   - Touch support for mobile devices
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Rod reset functionality (Shift+click)

2. **Calculation Features**
   - Real-time value display
   - Support for values up to 999,999,999,999.99
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - State persistence

3. **User Interface**
   - Responsive design (mobile-first)
   - Multiple visual themes
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Interactive tooltips

4. **Educational Components**
   - Interactive tutorials
   - Practice exercises
   - Visual feedback
   - Progress tracking

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Smooth animations (60fps) for bead movements
   - Load time under 2 seconds on standard connections
   - Efficient calculation engine for large numbers

2. **Usability**
   - Intuitive interface requiring minimal instruction
   - Consistent behavior across devices and browsers
   - Clear visual feedback for user actions
   - Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards

3. **Reliability**
   - State preservation during page refresh
   - Graceful degradation on older browsers
   - Error handling for invalid operations

4. **Compatibility**
   - Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
   - Touch and mouse input support

## 4. System Models
### 4.1 Abacus State Model
The abacus maintains state through:
- **Rod Values**: Each rod represents a place value (10^n)
- **Bead Positions**: Active/inactive status of each bead
- **Calculation History**: Stack of previous states
- **User Preferences**: Theme, sound settings, etc.

### 4.2 Interaction Flow
1. User initiates bead movement (click, drag, touch)
2. System validates the movement
3. Visual transition of bead(s)
4. Recalculation of current value
5. Update of display and history stack
6. Optional sound feedback

### 4.3 Component Diagram
The system consists of:
- HTML Structure (DOM elements)
- CSS Styling (visual presentation)
- JavaScript Controllers (interaction logic)
- Calculation Engine (mathematical operations)
- Storage Manager (state persistence)
